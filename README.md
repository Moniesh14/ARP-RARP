**ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):** ARP is a network protocol used to map an IP address to its corresponding physical MAC (Media Access Control) address within a local network. It allows devices to communicate by resolving the MAC address associated with a given IP address.

**RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol):** RARP is used to map a physical MAC address to its corresponding IP address. It is typically used by diskless devices to discover their IP address from a server when they only know their MAC address.
